### FreshCart is my first e-commerce project that is built using react.js.

It allows you to create an account, log in to it, and then add your needed & desired products to your cart or save them in your Wishlist for a future purchase.

Wondering if you can use your preferred payment method? I have counted everything, so you can choose to pay either in cash or online.

### Features & Tools:

- Authentication & Context 
- SPA & Routing using react router 
- Online Payment integration using strip payment gateway 
- Form handling & validation using Formik & Yup
- Fetching data from the API using axios.
- Caching displayed items using react query for a better UX
- React hooks (useEffect, useState, useParams, useNavigate)
- Generating separate meta titles & descriptions for each component using react-helmet
- Adding not found page.
- Pagination using react query
- Sass, Bootstrap & Fontawsome

I have built this project for testing & practicing, but I hope I can build a real one with additional features soon Insha`Allah.
